          <h5><span>Question: </span>What is the best single measure of the economic prosperity and well-being of a state's residents?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>“Per Capita Income”. Specifically: “Per Capita Personal Income” (PCPI) as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How does the economic prosperity and well-being of Mississippi's residents compare to that of other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Unfortunately, Mississippi is in last place, with a lower Per Capita Personal Income than any other state, as well as lower than that of the District of Columbia (which is quite high).</p>

        <div class="qa">
          <h5><span>Question: </span>How much does the per capita income of each Mississippian need to go up in order for Mississippi to move out of last place?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Mississippi generated roughly $106 Billion in personal income in 2015 and had a population of nearly three million (2,992,767). Mississippi’s per capita personal income (PCPI) was $35,444, well below the national average of $47,669. Currently 49th-ranked West Virginia’s per capita personal income is $37,047. Mississippi would need our per capita personal income to increase by $1,603 (almost exactly 4.5%) for every man, woman, and child in Mississippi ($6,412 annually for a family of four) in order to surpass West Virginia and no longer be ranked 50th.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How long has Per Capita Personal Income statistics been collected in the United States?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Since 1929.</p>

        <div class="qa">
          <h5><span>Question: </span>Where has Mississippi historically ranked in Per Capita Personal Income since recordkeeping started in 1929?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Unfortunately, Mississippi has ranked last in all but two years since 1929, which was the year that recordkeeping began. West Virginia ranked below Mississippi in 2005 and 2007 almost certainly due to federal funds that Mississippi received due to Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi has generally been converging on the national average since 1929, but its growth relative to the average has slowed and leveled out in recent years.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How many typical Mississippi jobs would Mississippi's economy need to add in order for the income of those jobs to get Mississippi out of last place?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>To achieve the status of 49th, Mississippi would need nearly 82,347 new jobs and total personal income would need to increase by $4.8 Billion (almost exactly 4.5%). To put this in perspective, consider that 76,500 people in Mississippi were counted as unemployed in May of 2016. Thus, Mississippi would need to employ all the unemployed and attract other individuals that are currently out of the labor force to work. Clearly, getting out of last place will require both a mix of more people employed, as well as greater income for those who already have jobs.
            <ul>
              <li>NOTE: It is important not to confuse supply with demand. Just because a new firm hires employees and opens for business doesn’t automatically result in an increase in employment in the economy. There must first be an increase in demand for the goods or services provided by the firm. Without an increase in demand, the new firm is just competing for existing market share and the employees at the new firm merely replace the employees lost by the firms that lost market share. The estimates on this website for each and every scenario are based on the assumption that demand is driving the employment gains.</li>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>Does the number of jobs required to get Mississippi out of last place account for the loss in welfare payments, unemployment benefits, food stamps, and other federal transfer payments that would be lost when those individuals start going to work?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Great question! Actually, it does not. Once the loss of those sources of income is accounted for, the actual number of typical Mississippi jobs required to close the gap to 49th is a good bit higher

          <h5><span>Question: </span>Are there other measures of per capita income?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Yes. The Census Bureau publishes Per Capita "Money" Income (PCMI), but Per Capita Personal Income (PCPI) as measured by the BEA is more accurate and more complete, given that it relies on administrative records rather than survey data, and that it is comprehensive in its measurement of income. The BEA’s measure also has the advantage of complete records at the state level since 1929, while Census money income arising from the ACS (American Community Survey) has only been recorded annually since 2008. Such detailed statistics as are available for BEA’s Per Capita Personal Income (PCPI) over a long timeframe are not readily available for other economic measures. To understand all the differences between PCPI and PCMI, please see Appendix 1 of the first report for a comprehensive overview.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>Does Mississippi's ranking improve when looking at Per Capita Money Income versus Per Capita Personal Income?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Unfortunately, by the “money income” measure, Mississippi is even worse off, as Per Capita Money Income does not include federal government transfer payments (welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, etc.), and Mississippi is a significant recipient of federal government transfer payments. A typical Mississippian in 2014 was more dependent on transfer receipts and received less compensation and asset income than the typical U.S. resident. Net earnings per capita were $20,544 in Mississippi and $29,577 in the nation. Dividends, interest, and rent per capita were $5,081 in Mississippi and $8,541 in the nation. Personal transfer receipts per capita were $8,806 in Mississippi and $7,932 in the nation.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>I see "Median Household Income" quoted in the media a lot. Is that a good measure?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Median Household Income is not nearly as useful of a measure as Per Capita Income because the size of an average household changes significantly (1) over time, (2) between geographies, (3) between races, (4) by age of population, and is influenced by numerous other factors. For example, as the prosperity of a state or country increases, many households that were comprised of multiple families will split apart with each family becoming their own household. When that happens, what was counted as two or three families composing a single "household” and “household income” becomes counted as two or three separate households.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>I’ve heard that Mississippi has a lower Cost of Living than other states. How does Mississippi’s ranking change if the numbers are adjusted for Cost of Living?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>When adjusted for cost of living (specifically cost of housing), Mississippi actually climbs about five spots in the rankings to 45th. While our per capita income is quite low, our cost of living (specifically housing) is very low. That means a person receiving average per capita income in Mississippi has more purchasing power and a higher standard of living (due to low housing costs) than an average individual in five other states. Those five states all have higher per capita income than Mississippi, but significantly higher cost of living (specifically housing), and thus less purchasing power than Mississippi. Those five states are: Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Hawaii, and Idaho. Below are some specifics:
          <ul>
            <li>The purchasing power of Mississippians in urban areas ranks 45th in the nation. This is due primarily to the fact that urban housing in Mississippi is only 73.5% of the national average. Some states have urban housing costs that are 160% to 170% of the national average. In short, more than double the costs in Mississippi.</li>
            <li>The purchasing power of Mississippians in rural areas ranks 40th in the nation. This is due primarily to the fact that rural housing in Mississippi is only 52.4% of the national average. Some states have rural housing costs that are 110% to 120% of the national average. In short, more than double the costs in Mississippi.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

        <hr />

        <div class="qa">
          <h5><span>Question: </span>How does Mississippi rank if you adjust for both cost of living and the slightly lower tax burden of Mississippi compared to some other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Accounting for Mississippi’s slightly lower tax burden by itself helps a little, but still leaves Mississippi in last place. Adding the somewhat lower tax burden on top of adjusting for cost of living causes Mississippi to climb one extra slot to 44th, rather than 45th if adjusted only for cost of living. In short, while Mississippi has slightly lower taxes than some other states, Mississippi has much lower cost of living than any other state. Adjusting for cost of living accounts for a much bigger leap in the rankings than adjusting for differences in taxes alone, which still leaves Mississippi in last place if not also adjusted for cost of living.</p>

        <hr />

        <div class="qa">
          <h5><span>Question: </span>Other than for cost of living and taxes, is Mississippi last in all other rankings?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Unfortunately, we seem to be last in most rankings, especially the big ones and the ones that matter. Also, in many of the rankings where we are not last, the ranking is of an "input measure" versus a "outcome measure". For example, it doesn't do any good to be ranked number one as the sports team that "practices for the most hours" (an input measure) unless somehow down the line that translates into "wins the most games" (an outcome measure). By the same token, being ranked as a "great place to do business" or a "great place to be an entrepreneur" only matters if ultimately businesses and entrepreneurs actually start and thrive in our state. Otherwise, we are just a great environment for an activity that isn't happening (or isn't happening enough).</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>Is the problem that not enough Mississippians are working? Or is the problem that those Mississippians that are working are not making enough money? If it is both problems, what % of the problem is “not enough working” and what % of the problem is “those working not making enough”?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>TThe problem is both. XY% of the problem is “not enough working” and XY% of the problem is “those working not making enough.”
          <ul>
            <li>Note: We are still working to determine the exact percentages for these two numbers. Check back soon!</li>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>For the “not making enough” part of the question above, are those individuals not making enough because they are working part-time? Or are they “not making enough” because they get paid less per hour of full-time work?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>This information is especially difficult to get. What we do know so far is this: The unemployment “U-6 rate” adds workers who are employed part time for economic reasons to the U-5 rate. As an example, workers may be employed part time for economic reasons when a full time job is not available to the worker due to a recession. Four percentage points of Mississippi’s total U-6 rate is the result of such part time workers. Mississippi has a higher proportion than neighboring states of such workers but is similar to the nation in this respect.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>What are “Blueprint States”?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Blueprint States are Mississippi’s neighboring states (Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee) plus Texas, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, and Florida. These were the states chosen by the State of Mississippi as a logical comparison group because these are the states that economic development professionals in Mississippi regard as our most closely aligned competitors. While national comparisons are interesting from an intellectual point of view, it is more important to note how our state compares to the market in which we compete vs. the nation as a while.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>What is the definition of (1) Labor Force, (2) Civilian Non-Institutional Population, and (3) Unemployed?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>
            <ul>
              <li>Labor Force – All persons in the civilian non-institutional population classified as either employed or unemployed.</li>
              <li>Civilian Non-Institutional Population – Includes persons 16 years of age and older, who are not inmates of institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.</li>
              <li>Unemployed – People are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
          See Report 2 for detailed descriptions and calculations. It is important to note from these definitions that people who are capable of working will not be counted as part of the labor force if they are not working and are not actively seeking employment. These individuals are technically out of the labor force even if they would like to have a job.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How have national Labor Force Participation Rates (LFPR) changed over time?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>TThere was an upward trend in LFPRs through the nineties that was driven by rapidly rising female LFPRs which dominated declining male LFPRs. Explanations for rising female LFPRs include rising real wages for women (which encouraged women to work more), changing preferences and attitudes toward women in the work place, improved household technology that decreased the amount of time necessary for household work, declining birth rates, and rising divorce rates. Some researchers have attributed the decline in LFPRs from 2000 to 2013 to increased retirement and disability and a significant increase in the number of discouraged workers, or workers who would like to have a job but who do not actively seek one and, as such, are not counted among labor force participants.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How has Mississippi’s Labor Force Participation Rates (LFPR) changed over time?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Mississippi’s LFPR has remained below the nation’s LFPR over this entire time period. In fact, Mississippi’s LFPR has diverged even further from the nation’s LFPR in recent years. Since 2005, Mississippi has persistently trailed neighboring states with the exception of pulling ahead of Alabama in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, Mississippi’s LFPR is lower today than it was in 1976.</p>

        <div class="qa">
          <h5><span>Question: </span>What is the reason for Mississippi’s lower Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) as compared to other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>According to research by the W.E. Upjohn Institute, there are five primary factors:

            <ol>
              <li>The relatively high concentration of Mississippi residents in Non-Metropolitan areas is the most consistent reason for Mississippi’s lower LFPR.</li>
              <li>Mississippi’s relatively high percentage of Black residents has a mixed impact on its LFPR. For Men and Younger Persons, it tends to reduce the LFPR. For Married Women, it raises the LFPR because the LFPR of Black Married Women exceeds that of White Married Women.</li>
              <li>Higher incidence of health problems also explain the lower LFPR of Mississippi.</li>
              <li>Higher incidence of government transfer receipt helps explain the lower LFPR of Mississippi.</li>
              <li>Lower educational attainment reduces the LFPR of Mississippi.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />

          According to the authors, these five measurable differences (percent in a Non-Metropolitan area, percent Black, percent with health problems, percent with government transfers, and lower educational levels) are capable of explaining “most” of the gap in LFPRs between Mississippians and individuals living in Blueprint States for all but Younger Persons that are ages 16 to 24. “For Younger Persons, more than half of the gap must be attributed to cultural, historical, and institutional factors that are difficult to measure and quantify.”

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How does the education of Mississippians compare to other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Mississippi trails the nation and its neighboring states. Of particular note, Mississippi is almost on par with Arkansas in terms of college graduates but Mississippi is a few percentage points behind Arkansas in terms of high school graduates. This difference is important because LFPRs tend to increase as education levels rise.

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How does the percentage of Mississippians who are disabled compare to other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>The percentage of individuals who are disabled is much higher in Mississippi and in the neighboring states than in the nation. Of the population under 65 years of age, 11.9 percent of Mississippians are disabled while only 8.5 percent of the nation is disabled. Arkansas experiences a slightly higher percentage at 12.2 percent. Additionally, a higher percentage of individuals younger than 54 receives Social Security Income in Mississippi relative to the comparison states. About 4.5 percent of Men 25-54 in Mississippi receive income from Social Security (presumably mainly in the form of Disability Income), compared with 3.8 in Neighboring States and 2.8 in the Blueprint States. These difference are substantial and suggest that the incidence of Social Security Disability receipt among prime-age males in Mississippi is 36 percent higher than in the Neighboring States, and 60 percent higher than in the Blueprint States. The differences are significant in view of the importance of Men 25-54 to the labor force.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>What are Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Social Security Disability Insurance program and the Supplemental Security Insurance program are both federally funded and run by the Social Security Administration. Social Security Disability is paid to disabled individuals who are insured, meaning that they worked for some period of time and paid Social Security taxes. The Supplemental Security Insurance program pays benefits based on financial need. See www.ssa.gov/disability for more details.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How does Mississippi’s racial composition compare to other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Mississippi’s racial composition is quite different from that of the nation. Nationally, 13.2 percent of the population is African American. Mississippi’s population is 37.5 percent African American, the highest of any state in the nation. Louisiana ranks second in the nation, with 32.5 percent of its population comprised of African Americans. This difference matters because African Americans have lower LFPRs than their Caucasian counterparts.</p>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How does the percentage of Mississippians living in urban vs. rural areas compare to other states?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Less than one-half of Mississippi’s population lives in urban areas. At 45.6 percent, the percentage of people living in an urban area in Mississippi is strikingly lower than the percentage for the nation as a whole (85.5 percent) and ranks last among the neighboring states. This difference is important because residents of non-metropolitan areas have lower LFPRs than do residents of metropolitan areas.

          <h5><span>Question: </span>What is the summary of all the Labor Force info above?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Mississippi has fewer individuals in the population who are of prime working age – ages 25 to 64. Mississippi has fewer individuals in the labor force than all neighboring states, including Arkansas even though Mississippi has a larger population. Mississippi has a lower labor force participation rate than neighboring states. That is, among the population that is eligible to work, fewer are working or attempting to work in Mississippi than in neighboring states. Mississippi’s lower overall labor force participation rate is driven by Mississippi’s demographic composition. Mississippi has a higher concentration of African Americans, disabled, and less educated individuals. Mississippi has more individuals living in non-urban areas as well. Each of these groups participates in the labor force at lower rates. For those participating in the labor force, Mississippians are unemployed at higher rates than in the nation and neighboring states.

          <h5><span>Question: </span>How have the various sectors of Mississippi’s economy changed over time?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>In Mississippi, there has been a dramatic drop in manufacturing employment since the mid-nineties. This drop in manufacturing employment has been somewhat but not completely offset by an increase in jobs in the leisure and hospitality industry after casinos were legalized in the state. Since 1990, Mississippi has experienced its highest level of growth in the leisure and hospitality, education and health services, and professional and business services industries. Note that the government sector has grown 20 percent since 1990 and it has been Mississippi’s largest employer since early 2000.

          <h5><span>Question: </span>What if Mississippi’s unemployment rate was more like our neighbors and all those additional people had jobs?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>If Mississippi’s unemployment rate was on par with the average unemployment rate in of its neighboring states, Mississippi’s unemployment rate would decrease from 6.5 percent to 5.9 percent. When applied to Mississippi’s labor force in 2015, this 0.6 percentage point decrease in Mississippi’s unemployment rate would mean that an additional 8,064 Mississippians would be employed. Assuming these individuals would contribute to the Mississippi economy at the average wage and using an overall state multiplier of XY, then state income would increase by XYZ.

          <h5><span>Question: </span>I’ve heard that the reason that Mississippi is last is because of “the Delta”. Is that true?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>No. That is not true, even though people keep saying it. The truth is that the 15 counties that compose “the Delta” are poorer on-average than the state as a whole, but the Delta county’s Per Capita Personal Income (PCPI) is only 9.3% lower than the rest of the state. Additionally, only 10.6% of Mississippi’s population lives in the Delta. For those two reasons, regardless of whether Mississippi’s per capita income is calculated with or without the Delta, Mississippi still ranks 50th. In fact, taking the Delta out of the equation only closes 22% of the gap between Mississippi and 49th. That still leaves 78% of the gap that must be solved by increasing income in all the non-Delta counties. To indicate how widespread low-income is in Mississippi, consider that only 9 counties in Mississippi have per capita income that is higher than West Virginia. That means that 73 counties, if they were states, would each individually rank 50th in per capita income. Incomes must be raised state-wide to lift Mississippi out of last place. Raising incomes in the Delta to the state average will only get Mississippi 22% of the way to 49th. See Appendix C in the report entitled “Per Capita Personal Income in Mississippi” for all the details.

Neshoba and Hinds would both rank 41st between Georgia and Arizona. Jones would rank 47th between New Mexico and Idaho. Lowndes, Warren, DeSoto, and Clarke would all rank 49th between South Carolina and West Virginia. All other counties (73 of the 82) would rank 50th if they were individual states.

          <p><span>Answer: </span>About 80% of state legislators in the Mississippi House and the Mississippi Senate represent all or part of one of the 73 counties that has a lower per capita income than West Virginia, and thus would rank 50th if it were a state. About 85% of state legislators in the Mississippi House and the Mississippi Senate represent all or part of one of the 77 counties that would rank 49th or lower if it were a state.

          <h5><span>Question: </span>Does where the boundary lines of Mississippi were drawn affect Mississippi’s rankings?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Yes. If the boundary lines of Mississippi had been drawn such that Mississippi had a major city the size of Memphis or New Orleans within its boundary lines, Mississippi would not be ranked 50th. Consider the following:
            <ul>
              <li>If Mississippi’s northern border was just 25 to 30 miles farther north, Mississippi would jump to 49th in the rankings. The reason is that Shelby County, Tennessee (the single county that encompasses Memphis) would be one of a total of four and a half counties that would be part of Mississippi vs. Tennessee. If that were the case, Mississippi would jump to 49th and Tennessee would fall two spots from 36th to 38th in the rankings.</li>
              <li>If Shelby County by itself (the single county that encompasses Memphis – but not the poorer counties east of Shelby County) was a Mississippi county vs. a Tennessee county, Mississippi would immediately jump three spots to 47th in per capita income. Just having that one county on the Mississippi-side of the state line adds nearly a million people and nearly $42B in income, which is a huge uplift. All from one county. Tennessee would only drop in the rankings from 36th to 37th if it lost just Shelby County.</li>
              <li>If Orleans Parish and St. Tammany Parish (the two counties that encompass most of New Orleans) were in Mississippi vs. in Louisiana, Mississippi would also immediately jump three spots to 47th in per capita income. Just having those two counties on the Mississippi-side of the state line adds over 600,000 people and nearly $30B in income, all from just two counties. Louisiana would only drop in the rankings from 30th to 32nd if it lost Orleans Parish and St. Tammany Parish.</li>
              <li>If the ten (10) parishes that are east of the Mississippi River (which encompasses New Orleans and Baton Rouge) were in Mississippi vs. in Louisiana, Mississippi would immediately jump six spots to 44th in per capita income rather than 50th. Having those ten counties on the Mississippi-side of the state line adds over 1,500,000 people and nearly $70B in income, all from counties that are on the Mississippi-side (east side) of the Mississippi River, but on the Louisiana side of the state line. Louisiana would only drop in the rankings from 30th to 32nd if it lost the ten (10) parishes that are east of the Mississippi River.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>NOTE: It requires a major city to change the rankings. If Mobile, Alabama was in Mississippi, that would not be enough to change the rankings. If Mississippi was able to duplicate the tri-county area (Madison, Ranking, and Hinds) somewhere else in the state, that would also not be enough by itself to change the rankings. Likewise, having Baton Rouge in Mississippi by itself (without New Orleans) is not enough to change the rankings. A major city like Memphis or New Orleans is the only thing related to boundary lines that changes the rankings.</li>

          <h5><span>Question: </span>Does Mississippi’s mix of urban vs. rural population impact our rankings?</h5>

          <p><span>Answer: </span>Yes. It does make a difference. Consider the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Mississippi is one of the most rural states in the nation with 54.4% of our population living outside of urban areas. Only three other states are more rural than Mississippi. Those three states are: Montana (64.4% rural), Vermont (65.5% rural), and Wyoming (69.5% rural). That means that Mississippi has a higher percentage of our population living in rural areas than even states such as Alaska, New Mexico, Idaho, West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</li>
              <li>If every state was like Mississippi and had 54.4% of their residents living in rural areas and 45.6% living in urban areas, than Mississippi would no longer be last, but would rank 48th ahead of South Carolina (49th) and Arizona (50th). The reason is that both Arizona and South Carolina have per capita incomes of their rural population that is lower than the per capita income of Mississippi’s rural population. The reason they don’t rank last overall is because neither state has very many people living in rural areas. In Arizona only 5% of the people live in rural areas and in South Carolina only 15% of the people live in rural areas. If those two low-income populations (the rural populations) were both much larger (as they are in Mississippi at 54.4%), that would result in South Carolina and Arizona ranking behind Mississippi.</li>
              <li>Overall the per capita income of Mississippi’s urban residents ranks 49th, ahead of Idaho.</li>
              <li>Overall the per capita income of Mississippi’s rural residents ranks 44th, ahead of Arkansas, Kentucky, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona (ranked 45th through 50th respectively). Mississippi’s rural residents rank behind West Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee (ranked 40th through 43rd respectively).</li>
